Today's Discussion:
-------------------
What is TestNG
Importance on TestNG along with Selenium
What are advantages of using TestNG
What are different feature of TestNG API to be incorporated into the test code.
----------------------------------------------------------

TestNG is a java based testing framework inspired by Junit.

It is used along with Selenium for customization and enhancement of the test code as per the test scenario, test automation needs and test automation guidelines...

TestNG is framework / API with collection of java based libraries ( class / interfaces / annotations)

** Selenium being an open source tool do not have sufficient features / fuctionalities to automate and application fully.

TestNG along with Selenium Test automation needs...

Benefits of using TestNG along with Selenium:
--------------------------------------------

1. Generate the HTML report post execution
2. Control the flow of execution using different types of annotations.
3. Asserts : Checkpoints used to compare expected values against the actual value --> Conditional verifications --> Hard assert & Soft assert
4. Test suite executions: we can the group of test using a suite --> testng.xml
5. Parallel testing
6. Cross Browser testing
7. Parameterization : reading the data from external sources --> @Parameters & @DataProvider
8. Prioritize, Enable / Disable the test, grouping etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Annotations in TestNG:

Is a pre-defined class in TestNG library used to declare a non static method.
The behaviour of the method below the annotation is completed controlled by the type of an annotation used.

Categorized into 3 types:
--------------------------

1. Annotations used for test fixtures :

Test fixtures are methods which are created to hold the code for pre & post conditions.

Always starts with either @Before  or @After.

@BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass, @BeforeMethod
@AfterSuite, @AfterTest, @AfterClass, @AfterMethod

2. Annotations used for test case: @Test

The method below the @Test annotation is called as test case that will have potential functionaliy under test
** A single class can have multiple @Test method.


3. Annotations used for paramterization --> 
	@Parameters : read the parameter value from a xml files
	@DataProvider : read to data from an Object[][]

Structure of TestNG code: / Order of execution.
<suite>
	<test>
		<classes>
			<class name = "">
		</classes>
	</test>
</suite>
<Suite> --> <test(s)> --><Classe> --> methods (@Test)
