Test Activities :
----------------

1. Test planning
2. Test designing
3. Test coding (Only when there is a decision to automate)
4. Test execution
5. Test Maintenance

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Automation Testing?
When an application under test is expected to be tested repeatedly. It is preferred to be automated.
>> Retesting, Regression Testing, Repeated input testing, Compatiablity testing / Cross browser testing
>> Non-functional testing : Performance testing, Stress Testing , Load Testing
------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Automation Testing?

A software (Automation testing tool) testing another software(Application Under Test)

A software tool is used to observe the functional behaviour of a software.
The QA is expected to instruct the automation tool through a code(test code) to make certain observation of the software under test.

What are the test automation activities?

1. Test designing : Writing the test code
2. Test execution : Execute the test code
3. Test maintenance : maintain the test code

SDET : Software Development Enginee For Testing.
------------------------------------------------
Selenium + TestNG + Apache POI + ExtentReports + Apache Maven + Jenkins + GitHub etc.

"It is a process of recording and playing back the user event to test the application for positive and negative test conditions".

recording : writing the test code 
playing back : executing the test code
user event : user interactions through Keyboard / mouse transactions

---------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-requisite of Test automation:
---------------------------------
1. Need to automated
2. Test cases that are chosen for automation
3. Test environment
4. Stable product / application
5. Test automation guidelines
6. Programming knowledge. - Java

** What can't be automation at a functional point of view?
OTP, Multi faction authentication, Captcha, Digital signature, Virtual Key board etc.

List of software :
------------------

1. Jdk 8 or 11
2. Eclipse IDE - Java EE developers - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/2022-06/R/eclipse-jee-2022-06-R-win32-x86_64.zip&mirror_id=1287
3. TestNG plugin should be installed in Eclipse IDE.
Install via Eclipse Marketplace
Go to the TestNG page on the Eclipse Market Place and drag the icon called "Install" onto your workspace.
Install from update site
Select Help / Install New Software...
Enter the update site URL in "Work with:" field:
Update site for release: https://testng.org/testng-eclipse-update-site.
Make sure the check box next to URL is checked and click Next.
Eclipse will then guide you through the process.

Introduction to Selenium:
--------------------------

Selenium is an open source web automation tool.

Developed by ThoughtWorks - 2004

History of Selenium, Details & documentation related to Selenium tool --> http://www.selenium.dev/

* Selenium is an automation tool used to functional test a web application.
Selenium is a functional testing tool used to test web application from front end / GUI --> Black box testing tool.

* Multi Language, Multi Browser & Multi platform.

As it is an open source all the components of Selenium can be free downloaded from the official web site of Selenium "Seleniu.dev"

There are 3 primary components of Selenium:

1. Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
2. Selenium RC(Outdated) / WebDriver
3. Selenium GRID
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

WebDriver : It is a selenium component used to automate the Web application.

WebDriver do not have an IDE / interface to write and run the program. It is downloadable as an API / self- contained library based on the language specification.

WebDriver supports different programing languages / client-bindings for coding.

IDE has to be chosen based on the choice of programing language.

Primary language is Java so Eclipse IDE as an automation tool integrated with Selenium as a platform to write and run the test automation code.

** IntelliJ / Spring Test Suite instead of Eclise IDE.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. How to create a project in Eclipse IDE. --> *Maven project
2. How to inject the selenium library to Eclipse project and make use of it as automation tool. --> Selenium library / dependency into the maven project created as per step1.
