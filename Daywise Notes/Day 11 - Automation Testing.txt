Today's Session:
----------------
JavaScriptExecutor - Interface used to perform JavaScript actions on the Browser isntance.


1. ScrollBy --> Horizontal & vertical scrolls
2. ScrollBy the presence of an element


--------------------------------------------------------

Synchronization Point

It is a process of matching the anticipated time between the tool and the application

Tool is faster than the application under test, We need use an extra time delay for smooth execution of the test code.

Available options:
------------------

Thread.sleep(timeout) : Java function will pause the execution till the timeout.
* Not recommended approach.

ImplicitWait : is performed on the driver.

* to wait for the element to be present on the driver instance.

* ElementNotFound / ElementNotInteractable.

driver.get("url");
// code to deal with the elements based on the presence on the pages
driver.close();
// The tool will implicitly wait till the element is loaded on the browser instance.
// We can choose maximum timeout while declaring the implicit wait
// ImplicitWait has auto=cutoff mechanism to skip the unused time and jump to next line of execution
// recommended to use implicit wait on the browser once the browser is launch.
// The implicitWait will automaticall wait for the presence of element on the page till the browser is terminated thru driver.quit() or diver.close();


PageLoadTime : Used on the driver wait till all the elements on the page are loaded.


ExplicitWait : Browser & Element on the browser till certain expected conditions are met.


Timeout will break once the condition is met.

Condition to break the timeout should be explicitly defined
WebDriverWait class.
